# Video Slideshow Creator
This Python script allows you to create a video slideshow by combining a series of images and an audio file. It uses the OpenCV and MoviePy libraries to generate the final video.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python 3: This script is written in Python 3, so you'll need a Python 3 installation.

OpenCV (cv2): Install OpenCV for image processing using pip:

Copy code
pip install opencv-python
MoviePy: MoviePy is used to edit and combine video and audio. Install it using pip:

Copy code
pip install moviepy
Usage
Image Folder: Place the images you want to include in the slideshow in a directory. Set the image_folder variable to the path of this directory in your script.

Audio File: Prepare an audio file (e.g., MP3 format) that you want to use as the background audio for your video. Set the audio_file variable to the path of this audio file in your script.

Output Video: Specify the name of the output video file by setting the video_name variable in your script.

Run the Script: Execute the script to create the video slideshow by running:

Copy code
python your_script_name.py
Clean Up: The script will create temporary video files. After creating the final video with audio, it removes the temporary video file. The final output will be saved as "final_output1.mp4."

Additional Notes
You can adjust the frame rate and codec used for video encoding by modifying the cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc and cv2.VideoWriter parameters in the script.

Make sure that your images in the image_folder are named in alphabetical order or according to the desired sequence.

This script assumes that your images are in JPG format. If you have images in other formats, update the script accordingly.

Please ensure that the audio duration matches the total duration of the images in the slideshow.
